## Features

- Precise timing: for speedsolvers, every hundredth of a second matters and is captured.
- Accurate timing: rather than relying on increments that drift, this mod records the actual time elapsed.
- Fuller scorekeeping: after a solve, both the move count and time are easily visible, so the two metrics can be recorded together.
