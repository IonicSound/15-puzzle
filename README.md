## Features

### Precise timing
For speedsolvers, every hundredth of a second matters and is captured.

### Accurate timing
Rather than relying on increments that drift, this mod records the actual time elapsed, giving players an honest representation of their skill.

### Fuller scorekeeping
After a solve, both the move count and time are easily visible, so the two metrics can be recorded together.
